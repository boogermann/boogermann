# ðŸ‘‹ Hello my friend, stay awhile and listen...

I'm Marcus and have spent 20+ years working and tinkering with technology.

I apply my skills (and curiosity) to interesting short and long-term opportunities and have substantive practical experience facilitating cutting-edge solutions with a broad range of skills.

Currently working on a personal project to create a retro gaming ecosystem, community and a digital media delivery service dedicated to the education, evolution and preservation of classic gaming and its legacy.

My proudest accomplishment was to have one of my projects being feature on major Brazilian media outlets including [Globo], [BBC Brazil] and even international outlets like the [N.Y Times] on a fight against Online Censorship by the Brazilian Government.
